# Aloud

    Aloud is an audio-memo application that allows vocal and sound artists to record, upload, and store drafts of work in progress in one convenient app.

### Features

    Within the app, Android users can quickly record live audio snippets, or upload previously recorded audio stored on a device.
    
    Users can also provide a description of the audio's context to store in a Library to be retrieved later for playback, and also have the ability to store recordings in user created collections.

### Problem

"Ever think of a really good line but can't think of the rest at the same time?"

With Aloud, users no longer have to worry about sudden bursts of creative inspiration with no place to keep track of them.

Anytime you're on the go and don't have a pen to jot something down, within 2 finger-presses users can record verbalizations, and store them quickly for later.

Users can reference recordings to see if the inspiration is worth hanging on to or removing. Additionally, users have the ability to hear other creators' audio and as well, richly adding to the creative experience of the application.

### Solution

    Aloud provides audio storage in a sleek, straightforward interface for users to interact with.

    While common to rely heavily on a visual representation of user media, Aloud provides a realm for musical and audio enthusiasts to share their inspirations and creations as well.

### Note from the Three of Cups

    We designed this app to be a new way for creators to interact with their audio-based media in a format that can group together and track previous work as well as work in progess.

How to Get Started
